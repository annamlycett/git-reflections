>>When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

When working remotely (not from your regular office or workstation);
also, possibly, when collaborating with others who may be working on
the same file/project as you.


>>Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Otherwise you could be uploading changes before they are ready to go
live.
