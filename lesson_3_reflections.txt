>>When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

When working remotely (not from your regular office or workstation);
also, possibly, when collaborating with others who may be working on
the same file/project as you.


>>Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Otherwise you could be uploading changes before they are ready to go
live.


>>Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

FORKS are used to copy another GitHub user's repository onto my GitHub
account.

CLONES are used to copy a GitHub or a local repository onto my machine.

BRANCHES are a way of labelling commits within a file's history locally
or on GitHub.
