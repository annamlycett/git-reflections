>>What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a link to a directory.
You need to do it in order to make it work
before adding specific files to the repository
to use it for version control.

According to the documentation,
"this command creates an empty Git repository
- basically a .git directory with subdirectories
for objects, refs/heads, refs/tags and template files.
An initial HEAD file that references the HEAD
of the master branch is also created."


>>How is the staging area
different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

It's an extra step that allows for additional control
over what goes into a given commit,
helping keep it more logical and organised.
The repository is where everything happens on Git,
while a working directory is where you actually are working.
